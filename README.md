## Fastify x Express

- Microframework (it doesn't require requirements to work, such as mass structure, which framework will work, etc.)
- Fastify has more updates than Express
- Fastify is more popular
- Fastifay is more performant
- Fastify is very similar to Express (if you ever need to work with Express there will be no problem)
